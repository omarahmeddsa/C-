# C++ Functions: Returning Values, Large Objects, and Compatibility

## Returning values in functions of C++ programs

### Returning Large Objects by Reference

Write a function named `modifyVector` which takes a vector of integers and modifies its first element to be 42, returning the modified vector by reference.

### Never Regress and Abuse Backward Compatibility

Given an older version of a function `oldAddition` that takes two integers and returns their sum. Create a new version called `newAddition` that uses default parameters so that it can work with one or two integers.

### Suffix Return Type

Implement a function `multiply` which multiplies two numbers. The return type should be specified using a suffix return type syntax.
